# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I am a Computer Science (and prospective Political and Social Thought) student at the University of Virginia!
* Excited for the ways 0's and 1's might help us become more curious and creative people.
* You don't need to spend very long on my profile to discover that I have a special twitch for writing, those who write, and the things they write with (which in our golden moment no longer means only pens and pencils).
  * Check out my most recent project, "Watson Notes App"! It's a web application scratching the itch of just such a niche! 
  * My previous project was a desktop-based Java application designed for similar purposes. Still public in my repositories, it's mostly attrophied into a fun proof-of-concept.
